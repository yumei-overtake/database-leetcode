import pandas as pd

def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return customers[~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])][['name']].rename(columns={'name':"Customers"})


# ['name'] is series [['name']] is DataFrame
# this question can be solved by join Customer with Order, and check null. But isin is faster
